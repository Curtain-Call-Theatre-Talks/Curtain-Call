            <li>Font choices: Curtain Call uses two main fonts as part of its brand identity: Righteous for titles, and Nunito Sans for general text. Righteous fits our values very well, as its sharp edges communicate stability and safety, but the funky corners and curves still show the playful nature of our brand. Furthermore, since it is a Sans Serif font, Righteous is easy to read on any screen. Nunito Sans has more of a general appearance, with this choice, the main goal was just easy readability.

          <h2 id="marketing" class="mt-5">Marketing</h2>
          <h4 id="marketing-1" class="mt-2">Context of campaign and promotional activities</h4>
          <p><strong>Context of the campaign:</strong> The message that Curtain Call aims to convey to its audience is simple: Theatre can easily be transformed from an intimate experience to a social one. Our whole promotional campaign was designed with this message in mind. With our communication, we want to inspire more people to go to the theatre, and connect them to each other in the process, so they can exchange opinions, talk about performances, form connections, and in the end, get a much more nuanced understanding of the art of theatre. Keeping these goals at the forefront of our campaign, we consinstently use a very friendly, reassuring and personal tone, so people feel that their intimate opinions and thoughts are safe with us, and Curtain Call is an open place for discussions.<br>
            <strong>Executed activities:</strong> First, we announced the brand itself and teased the launch of the app and website. Then we introduced our team in several different posts. After this, we wanted to show a bit more personal side of the brand, so we created some sketches in the form of Reels. These played on existing social media trends, showed the effect of people using our app, and one of them also featured our manager talk about the app and its features. We also introduced our target audience to our vision and values in the latest posts, and finally announced the launch of the website.
            
          </p>
          <p><strong>Chosen channels and goals:</strong> instagram facebook</p>
          <h4 id="marketing-2" class="mt-4">Learning Points</h4>
		  <p><strong>Learning point 1: The more planning, the better.</strong> We have learned that when it comes to actually executing a marketing campaign, if we want everything to work how we intended it to work, it is of utmost importance to plan out everything well in advance, down to the smallest detail possible. We had many great ideas for marketing, like certain Instagram Reels, videos about people using our app, and so on, but in the end we didn't have time to actually create most of these, due to a lack of planning. We didn't create a posting schedule beforehand, we just had certain post ideas planned out, but no actual plan for when and what we are going to post. This would have allowed us to create an overarching concept through our advertising, and make it much more enticing for our target audience. Through the execution process, we have recognized the importance of planning our activities in advance, and sticking to that posting schedule. In future projects, we will pay much more attention to planning.</p>
		  <p><strong>Learning point 2: It is easy to get too ambitious.</strong> As none of us had any previous experience about what it's like to establish social media presence from nothing for a brand that was just created, we found it difficult to come up with realistic goals. The only experience we could base these on was our own social media pages, and our previous projects. Towards the end of the project, we started realising that our goal of 100 followers on Instagram was a bit too ambitious compared to what we managed to reach in the end (Actually, almost none of the pages created for Brand Development reached this number.) Therefore, it is important to take into consideration our limitations, such as the fact that this is a completely new page and no one is going to hear about it naturally, if we don't establish a constant presence. On the other hand, we could have also done more to get followers, such as specifically asking people to follow us, or in case of a real brand, even paid advertisements.</p>
		  <p><strong>Learning point 3: Some other takeaways.</strong> </p>	

          <h4 id="marketing-3" class="mt-4">Future Planning</h4>
          <p>Reflection on what has been done and describe in detail what you would do if the project would continue.</p>
          <p>Describe in detail your future recommendations if the campaign would be continued.</p>
          <p>Detail and describe clearly the process of what your would do differently based on you experience on this project related to the marketing assignment.</p>
          <h4 id="marketing-4" class="mt-4">Professionalism</h4>
          <p>Present and organize below all social media/online activities of the campaign. Context and material are according to the brand style, image, and vision. Images on the site are of high-quality, readable, and properly designed.</p>
